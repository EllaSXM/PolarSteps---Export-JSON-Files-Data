# PolarSteps---Export-JSON-Files-Data

**Why this code?**
I did a year long journey and used Polar Steps to document location and my daily thoughts.
After I was back I wanted to save my journal entries and location from polar steps to future proof the loss of that data.
PolarSteps sent me the data in JSON files with MANY nested lists and so I wrote this code to extract that data in a more user-friendly format. 


**What does the code do?**
This codes extracts my journal text, titles and some other information that I found relevant.
The data is then stored in a word file. 

**Why share?**
Well, I looked online and couldn't find any reports of anyone who had done this using Python. There was one guy who had done this with R. 
So, I saw this as a challenge to work on my python coding skills and upload a first GitHub post. 
Also, it would be great if other people saved time and could access their own data with my code!
Cheers!

# Extracting Your Data From PolarStep's JSON Files

Hello Fellow Travelers! 

**Why is a traveller writing this code?**
I did a year long journey and used Polar Steps to document location and my daily thoughts.
After I was back I wanted to save my journal entries and location from polar steps to future proof the loss of that data.
PolarSteps sent me the data in JSON files (sigh) with MANY nested lists (sigh again) and so I wrote this code to extract that data in a more user-friendly format. 

**What does the code do?**
This codes extracts my journal text, titles and some other information that I found relevant. ( you could question the relevance of a weather forecast that says "rainy" for most of my posts). 
The data is then stored in a word file. 

**Why am I sharing this, when you could have a chance to rant and be upset with PolarSteps and the World?**
Well, I looked online and couldn't find any reports of anyone who had done this using Python. There was one guy who had done this with R and he posted his code. 
So, I saw this as a challenge to work on my python coding skills (see I stopped travelling and felt a bit lost so I needed a new hobby) and upload a first GitHub post. 
Also, it would be great if other people saved time and could access their own data with my code (I mean this genuinely)!
Cheers!

OK Some Helpful Notes to Actually Use The Code. 

1. You need to request your data from PolarSteps. This can be done somewhere in settings in the app. I'm sure you'll find it.
2. Once you get the data, look for the JSON files.
